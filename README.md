# Braille Writer
This app is a simulator for a physical braille writer. While it's best to learn braille using a regular braille writer, in certain cases it's beneficial to have one on a computer or touch screen device.

## Intended Use
This app is meant to be used be people with all levels of sight. If you are brailling on the go, you can use this app on a tablet. If you can't afford a braille-writer, this app is for you. If a friend or family member is learning braille on a traditional braille writer and you want to learn as well, give this app a try! This app is not meant to replace a traditional braille writer, but to provide options for the times one cannot be used.

## Supported Devices
### Tablets
On a tablet, position the devices in landscape mode, and press on the keys just as you would a traditional braille writer

### Desktop/Laptop
For non-touch devices, I've added keyboard support to simulate buttton pressing. Place your hands in normal typing position (pointer fingers on the F and J keys).

Keys are as follows:
1 Dot: F
2 Dot: D
3 Dot: S
4 Dot: J
5 Dot: K
6 Dot: L
Space: Spacebar
Backspace: Backspace
Newline + Carriage Return: Enter

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
